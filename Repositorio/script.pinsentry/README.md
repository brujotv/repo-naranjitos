PinSentry is an addon that will allow you to set a pin code that you can then force to be input when you play a particular video file or navigate into a given TV Show or Plugin. There is also an option to force the user to enter a pin when the system starts, and then restrict the amount of time the user is allowed each day.

Please read the wiki for more details:
